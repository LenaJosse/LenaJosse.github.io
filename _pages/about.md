About me
=====
PhD student in the Astrochemistry & Origin team of the [Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale](https://www.ias.u-psud.fr/) (Université Paris-Saclay & CNRS), my research focuses on returned samples from the asteroid Ryugu, a near-earth asteroid sampled by the [Hayabusa2](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/current/hayabusa2.html) mission from the Japanese space agency JAXA.
