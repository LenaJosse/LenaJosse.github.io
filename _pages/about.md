About Me
=====
PhD student in the **Astrochemistry & Origin** team of the **[Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale](https://www.ias.u-psud.fr/)** (Université Paris-Saclay & CNRS), my research focuses on returned samples from the **asteroid Ryugu**, a near-earth asteroid sampled by the **[Hayabusa2](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/current/hayabusa2.html)** mission from the Japanese space agency JAXA. 

Over the past three years, I have mainly studied one Ryugu sample, **A0159**. It’s only about 3 millimeters across, but this tiny grain is fascinating — it shows a wide variety of interesting features! For example, my colleagues and I detected a **millimeter-sized carbonate vein** (click [here](https://lenajosse.github.io/portfolio/) to see the vein in the grain), the first such structure ever observed in either Ryugu samples or in the closest meteorites, the CI chondrites.

I love **experimental work** and have strong skills in acquiring and analyzing **X-ray computed tomography (XCT)** data. So far, I have worked exclusively with synchrotron radiation-based XCT, but I hope to learn how to use laboratory-based instruments in the future. I also have experience in **spectroscopy** and **microscopy**.

With my background in geology, I like to describe myself as an **astrogeologist** — someone who studies the mineralogy and structure of extraterrestrial materials to better understand their geological history.
