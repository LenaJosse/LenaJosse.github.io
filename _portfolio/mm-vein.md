This figure shows a millimeter-sized carbonate vein (in yellow) within grain A0159. The vein was identified using a threshold-based segmentation method applied to synchrotron radiation X-ray computed microtomography (SR-µXCT) data. This image is reproduced from the publication **3D SR-µXCT Analysis for Lithology Detection: Application to Ryugu Sample A0159**, published in _Meteoritics & Planetary Science_ (2025).
